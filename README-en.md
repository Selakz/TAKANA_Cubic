## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

The project is divided into three main assemblies with a strict dependency flow:

- **App**: Contains codes which are independent of the app's specific functions.

- **MusicGame**: Contains all logic related to the chart editor. The `ChartEditor` module depends on other internal parts.

- **T3Framework**: A general-purpose framework developed during this project:

  - `Preset`: High-reusability components oriented towards specific business needs (e.g., UI components).

  - `Runtime`: Unity-based framework foundation for extending specific scripts.

  - `Static`: Pure C# framework code, independent of the Unity engine.
